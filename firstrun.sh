### --- Username Selection ---
### Grabs your username from Bash conner variable
### Example UNIX username: conner
### USERGRAB=1 to capitalize the first letter. Output: Conner
### USERGRAB=2 to keep the username as it is. Output: conner
### Add quotation marks to manually specify a name. Output: HamBurger

USERGRAB=1

DEVICE="Laptop"

### ---Distro Selection ---
### If you set DISTRO=true, it will grab your distro name using /etc/issue
### Otherwise, if you set it to a string (eg: ), the distro value on the output will be whatever your string is.
### If you set ISLINUX=true, it appends "Linux" to your distro name.
### Example 1: ISLINUX=true DISTRO=true   Output: Ubuntu Linux
### Example 2: ISLINUX=true DISTRO="Hamburger"    Output: Hamburger Linux
### Example 3: ISLINUX=false DISTRO=true    Output: Ubuntu

ISLINUX=true
DISTRO=true

### --- Model Selection ---
### Grabs your hardware name
### Example: Latitude 7490, Parallels ARM Virtual Machine, etc
### If set to 'true' (no quotations), it will grab the model name from /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name
### To set the value manually, simply encase it in quotation marks, "like this".

MODEL=true

### --- Weather Settings ---
### To choose operands for wttr.in, visit https://wttr.in/:help

WTROPTIONS="2FnQ"
MOONOPTIONS="F"
## If true, weather and moon display side by side. If false, weather displays above moon.
WTRSIDE=true

### --- RAM Display ---
## If you'd like to lie- I mean, manually specify your RAM count, simply set RAM="123456M" or RAM="16G" or whatever
#RAM=15861M
RAM=true

### --- Animation settings ---
ANIMATE=true
## Seconds between drawing frames for animation.
SLEEP=0.05

# Here you can change the date and time messages and date variables. 
TODAY=$(date +"Today's date is %A, %B %d %Y.")
TIMENOW=$(date +"The local time is %r")

# Hides your city name in your output
hidecity=false

# To set which commands appear after the weather, add these commands in commands.txt
# Sorry if you were expecting to add them here. :(
# If you add commands here, they won't show up, since this file is sources before the animation happens.
